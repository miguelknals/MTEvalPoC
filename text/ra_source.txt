The deployment directory stores the files that are required for test execution.
After you change a report, the changes are saved to the workspace.
Charging for a run depends on the number of virtual tester hours.
If the validation is successful, the cost of the run is displayed.
This process might take some time, depending on the number of agents.
Click the user group for which you want set the cache limit.
You can use a condition to highlight a specific performance problem area.
A valid start time is any value between 0.0 and end time.
You must have access to the classes that contain the exchanged objects.
This can cause the agent computer to exhaust all available TCP/IP ports.
If a test contains loops, virtual users attempt to re-use existing connections.
See the installation guide for more information on managing protocol license keys.
Put the different project assets in separate folders under the main project.

You can specify a range from no delays to twice the recorded length.
To fix this problem, reduce playback speed until the test runs correctly again.
You can enable response time breakdown collection at the parent or page level.
Include sites that are contained in, or overlap with, an existing substitution site.
For example, you can choose to automatically transform binary data to ASCII format.
Enter the longest delay, in milliseconds, that the generator allows between page requests.
By default, the Referer field in an HTTP request header is correlated automatically.
The downside of this setting is that it can result in incorrect correlations.
The most common example of losing changes occurs in the Page Percentile report.
Indicates whether a test value contains special characters such as spaces or commas.
Indicates the additional delay, in milliseconds, to wait before this request is issued.
This action models the behavior of a user closing and reopening a browser.
This option prevents virtual users from selecting duplicate values (for example, account IDs).
For example, assume a selector contains six blocks set to the following weight:
