Apartment in the trees :)
{B9E757AD-9460-425F-8482-92A16BA1103E}
This is a well-designed resort complex nestled in a landscape of trees.
The golf course and facilities - restaurant/ bars etc are complemented by the individual self-contained villa apartments nestled in the trees.
This approach provides the best of both worlds.
We stayed with friends in Villa 705.

An Aussi gem set in a picturesque country setting with a first class golf course as a bonus.
The reception is very spacious and welcoming with transport available to your room.
Mine was a 2 bedroom bungalow with 2 ensuites and a full kitchen, dining and living rooms.
It also had a balcony overlooking the golf course which was in addition to the golfers frequented by mobs of kangaroos leaving one with no worries about where in the world they are.

We stayed 3 nights at the Oaks iStay Precinct to explore Adelaide.
We got a great deal, which included wifi access, in a one bedroom apartment with a view towards the ocean (some distance away but visible).
The little outside area with wide opening windows was lovely.

Stayed here alone for a conference.
I had a one bedroom apartment.
So lovely.
Beautiful furnishings, well appointed, spacious.
Had plenty of cutlery and crockery.
It felt so big having it all to myself.
I didn't find it noisy.
The lifts were a bit slow though.
The location was great.
Easy walk to mall, convention centre.
Found bottle shop and good eating places close by.
The staff were friendly.
Check in was a breeze and they were happy to provide directions, book taxis etc.
I'd definitely stay here again with family and friends if visiting Adelaide.

We stopped in the Margaret 212 for four days in August.
The weather was beautiful.
We stayed in a one bedroom apartment on the 27th floor.
The views were really nice overlooking the botanical gardens and the ongoing expansion of Brisbane's skyline.
The balcony was large.
We stayed as a family of me, my partner and my five year old son.
The apartment was modern, furnished well and had everything you needed to be self sufficient.

We visited Broome for 4 days in August, having flown to Perth to meet our Australian friends.
We stayed in a two bedroom apartment at Oaks which was of a very good hotel standard combined with all the conveniences of self-catering accommodation.
Bedrooms well-appointed and very comfortable, bathrooms of high standard, with a spa in one room.
Well equipped kitchen and dining areas meant we could combine economical meals with great restaurant choices in the town.
Very comfortable shared lounge area with big TV.

The local bus stop is directly outside the resort.
There is a 10 minute walk to Cable Beach

We only stayed one night, but I would go back again and stay longer.
We had a room on the 31st floor, overlooking Southbank.

Staff were helpful and polite.

We stayed in a 3 bedroom apartment at the Oaks Casino Towers for a Hens get together with a group of friends and to be honest we could not have asked for a better experience.
The views from the room was amazing, the room itself was huge with great facilitates and being in such a central location to both the city and Southbank made it very easy to get out and about.
As we all know the staff at the hotel can often make or break a stay and I have to say that every single staff member I encountered from booking the room right through to check out was friendly, efficient and went out of there way at every opportunity to help out and accommodate our needs.

We spent more than our usual budget here for our family and it was worth every penny.
We arrived in dark and awoke to the lake view and the Remarkables.
It was simply breathtaking.
We had a large balcony terrace and the hot tub was the best way to sit and take in the view.

I've been in and out of the Oaks Embassy for years now and this trip was no different.
Good service by the late night clerk on check in, spacious and super-comfortable apartment and good location.
It's close to the river, the convention centre and eating options.
Oaks Embassy is still my default choice and always up to the mark.

"Riverview"
I can't begin to express our gratitude for our recent stay.
We booked an apartment with a kitchen, big plus, being a chef.
Also, eating out everyday can be costly.
We also had a washer/dryer in our room, as well as a great view of the Story Bridge and Brisbane River.
The amenities were proper, our room was sufficient, plenty of space, clean and secure.
I would definitely recommend the Oaks Felix to anyone, who is planning on staying in Brisbane.

"Very nice!"
This was our first stay at Oaks Felix.
We have stayed at other Oaks properties before and have been impressed with the standard of accommodation in the past.
This experience was no different!We stayed here after attending the Ekka and it was nice to sit down and rest our feet upon arrival, after a big day of walking.
We had a One Bedroom Executive room on the 35th floor and the view from the balcony was just stunning, overlooking the river.

"Very Happy Customer"
I have stayed at the Oaks Festival Towers many times, and it's just too hard to risk going elsewhere that will not be as welcoming and comfortable.
The staff are always friendly, they remember you and do what they can to make you feel at home.

"Central, Spacious, Excellent."
The Oaks Festival Towers has a brilliant location in the heart of the Brisbane CBD, with excellent well maintained amenities and friendly helpful staff.
The rooms are all well provided, very clean, with a dishwasher, washing machine and dryer all included.
Downstairs there are a multitude of restaurants and cafes nearby including Queen Street Mall which is only a short walk away.
Going back to Brisbane again for work and will stay here again without hesitation.

"Top Hotel in Top Location"
This hotel has one of the best positions in all Townsville.
Right on Palmer St, and only a short walk to Flinders St. Everything that you could want is nearby.
Thanks to Amanda and all the ladies for some fabulous service during our stay.
The room was fabulous, with views across Townsville to Magnetic Island.
Rooms are practical and provide the option of eating in being fully self-contained.
Also having laundry facilities in the room is a great benefit for a stay of any length.

We arrived at the Oaks quite late at night, so yes two very grumpy kids and husband.
I wish I could remember the name of the really nice lady who checked us in, she couldn't of been more helpful.
Apartment was fabulous, clean tidy warm and very comfortable, the view of the harbour was really nice, yes I will mention that there is a huge hotel being built in front but it does not cut that much of the harbour out.

"A very pleasant stay and great location"
We stayed here for three nights while attending the Cabaret Festival at the very close Festival Centre.
It is also very close to the Adelaide Oval, the Casino, the Railway Station and less than a 10 minute walk to Rundle Mall.
We had a one bedroom apartment which was north facing so it got the sun for most of the day.
Although it was facing North Terrace once the balcony doors were closed the was almost no road or tram noise.
We found the front desk service to be excellent.
The check-in was quick and any questions we had during our stay were answered in a helpful manner.

We booked Oaks Horizons as our usual hotel was booked solid for that week.
There is always some trepidation when booking somewhere else when you have always stayed in a hotel you love.
Any unease were soon dispelled.
The reception staff were excellent and were efficient and extremely helpful.
The room itself was generous in size and extremely clean and comfortable.
It was also exceptionally quiet.
Will be back.

We have been coming back to Oaks Lagoons swim out apartment for the past 9yrs.
Stayed for the month of August the manager Murray and his team do a great job keeping guests happy and informed on all that is on offer in this area of FNQ.
The apartments, pools (1 being heated) BBQ
areas are all very well maintained.
The resort is a 5/10 minute drive out of town, shuttle buses are frequent and the beautiful 4Mile Beach is at the end of the street.

"Fabulous Brisbane CBD apartment"
Cheaper than a hotel room but you have a lounge room, kitchen and balcony with sliding doors off the bedroom as well.
Our apartment was on the sixth floor and we watched the sunset while relaxing.
Very new and clean.
Woolworths is just across Cathedral Square which is across the road, so supplies are handy.

{D6386357-B28B-4010-B91A-86BCE25096A0}
I spent a total of 2 months (approx 60 days) at the Oaks Liwa Heights so I got to know the place very well.
The reception staff were very helpful and attentive as were the parking attendants in the car park below the building.
The apartments are spacious and light (I stayed on the first floor) and was lucky to have a very large balcony.
The location is great.
You're close to a couple of supermarkets, good places to eat plus a taxi journey to Dubai Marina is just a short journey away.
All in all the Oaks Liwa Heights is a safe bet on my list of places to stay in Dubai for pretty much everyone; families, business travellers, couples and singles.
It's a comfortable and reliable 'home from home' place where you can totally kick back and be yourself.

We have just stayed 5 nights at the Oaks M on Palmer in beautiful Townsville, North Queensland.
The first thing you notice is how friendly the staff are, from the reception to the cleaners all very friendly.
It was a pleasant surprise when we entered our room, it was located on the 7th floor and had double door security.
The Studio was very well appointed, it was fully self-contained.

We had booked several months ago as we are from Sydney and were coming to the Ekka.
This hotel is in a fantastic location an easy 5 minute walk to the entrance.
Also across the road from the Brisbane Hospital so would assume it very handy for people needing to be close by to this.
The rooms are generous in size everything lovely clean and new.
Beds are great very comfy and pillows lovely.
Shower great pressure.
Grounds are a little oasis lovely ponds and the pool looked fabulous.

"Best Services EVER!!!"
My Wife and myself where in Brisbane with our Stud Cattle for the Brisbane Royal Show and the Location of Oaks Mews Apartments fitted the bill for location.
Coming from the bush were you don't have much traffic noise was a concern, are we going to get any sleep?
But the way the Apartments are setup there was no noise and a very relaxing environment.
The facilities are very well appointed and last but by no means least the Staff were unbelievable, bright & cherry and nothing was too much trouble.
And the behind workers (the cleaning staff) need to be congratulated in the excellent job they do.
We travel a lot with our cattle and stay in different accommodation and this would have to be the best by a long way!!!

Found this place on a recent work trip and booked it for familiarity.
It is an Oaks property so you know what you are getting.
It is relatively new, and has large sliding doors facing the court yard.
Very clean and superbly maintained.
This is mining country, so there isn't much here.
There is an IGA with a limited range in town, so you won't starve, and there is a subway and local restaurant nearby.
Staff are very hands on and a great help.

"Amazing hotel with gorgeous views"
We stayed at Oaks Shores for 7 nights it was fabulous!
The two bedroom apartment was very spacious allowing the four of us to feel very comfortable.
The spacious lounge/dining and kitchen areas were beautifully decorated.
The gas fire place and heated floors were a welcome surprise.
The views of the Remarkables and the Lake from the apartment were spectacular, we even had views from the bed.
We used the in room laundry regularly.
The house keepers were thorough and discrete.
Front Office Staff welcoming and hospitable.
Only issue we had was that we were not ready to leave.
We will definitely go back again when we can.
I would recommend it to both families, couples and corporate travellers alike.

"Enforced Stopover"
I was sick with flu and pneumonia and my partner Michael needed a place to stay so we chose Oaks South Yarra.
Fully serviced - great location and close to Epworth Private Hospital.
Michael RAVED about the attention he received from management who enquired about me every day.
Wonderful place and great people - staff are great and prices fabulous.
Well worth recommending.

"Another great stay"
This was our 4th or 5th stay in these apartments and once again they did not disappoint.
Reception staff were very helpful, particularly Kasun who went out of his way to help us when we needed to access our car after the carpark had closed for the night.
We were upgraded to a 1-bed apartment at check-in which is always appreciated.
The apartment was clean and well equipped, with a good kitchen and even a washer and drier in the bathroom.
The location is great, right next to South Yarra station (we did not have any issues with train noise) and an easy walking distance to many restaurants.
We will definitely be back!

"Great little find, fantastic location"
We booked a 2 bedroom apartment.
Two bathrooms as well.
Very comfortable new apartment centrally located across the road from Eureka Tower and The Langham.
Short walk to Southbank where you can head to Crown Casino to the left, Federation Square to the right and across the bridge over the Yarra to Flinders Street Station.
Friendly, helpful staff and well-appointed kitchen.
Highly recommend a stay here particularly if you intend going to a sporting venue nearby.

"Great accommodation at a great price!!!"
My husband and I stayed in a one bedroom apartment, the room was very spacious, with a good size balcony to enjoy the fresh air and the apartment had everything you needed as it is fully self-contained.
The rooftop terrace with a pool, two spas, two barbecue areas a chess set and plenty of seating ranging from lounges, bean bags, sun lounges and a hammock was a beautiful area to enjoy.

"Oaks Woolloongabba"
The Oaks Woolloongabba is a very nice new hotel.
The rooms were immaculate and very modern and the bed was very comfortable.
It has a great rooftop pool area and it is very handy to The Gabba and Brisbane.

"Amazing city views"
The Milton Brisbane was by far one of the most comfortable and relaxing 4 day breaks I've had in a long time!
We had a gorgeous 1 bedroom suite on the 28th floor.
The views from this room were spectacular, the bedroom and bathroom space very spacious and the convenience of having the train, bus and ferry all within walking distance was an absolute bonus.
A special mention to Chari and her team at the front desk is warranted.
We truly appreciated the special attention and care taken with our reservation and definitely made our stay in Brisbane a very memorable one.

K8880XCpaulw
My wife and I recently had a 3 1/2 week travelling holiday which included a 3 night stay at The Milton.
It was great accommodation - clean; well appointed; spacious and very comfortable.
We stayed on Level 22 and had great views over the river.
It was our pick of accommodation during our holiday.
Highly recommended for luxury self-catering accommodation.

"Great hotel in an awesome location"
Very nice hotel.
Friendly staff.
Stay on a higher floor in a corned unit.
The views are amazing with huge windows from floor to ceiling.
Very quiet.
Lobby is beautiful and nice to come back in with the fire going after a wet and windy day in the city.
Walking distance to everything.

COND&#201; NAST TRAVELER US NAMES NALADHU PRIVATE ISLAND MALDIVES BEST RESORT IN THE INDIAN OCEAN TWO YEARS IN A ROW
Secluded beaches, 20 luxurious houses, kaleidoscopic reefs – Naladhu Private Island Maldives is a vision of tropical perfection.
The readers of Cond&#233; Nast Traveler US agree.
For the second year running, Naladhu Private Island Maldives has been named the Best Resort in the Indian Ocean as well as No 3 in the world in the Cond&#233; Nast Traveler Readers' Choice Awards.
The Cond&#233; Nast Traveler Readers' Choice Awards are considered amongst the travel industry's most prestigious.
More than 300,000 readers nominate their favourite hotels out of the most luxurious and distinguished properties across the globe.
Naladhu Private Island Maldives offers a unique take on the Maldivian experience, with toes-in-the-sand luxury, elegant colonial-style villas, dedicated 24/7 on-call house masters and pristine white beaches.
Here, guests can enjoy absolute pampered privacy – a palm-fringed island all to themselves – with the facilities of Anantara Dhigu and Anantara Veli just across the lagoon.
It's a recipe that has won the heart of every guest to set foot on its shores.
"To be consistently named by Cond&#233; Nast Traveler readers as the number one resort in the Indian Ocean is a great privilege," says Coetzer Deysel, General Manager at Naladhu Private Island, Anantara Dhigu and Anantara Veli.
"We strive to deliver nothing short of the exceptional to our guests, and to receive this award for the second year in a row is testament to our team's unwavering commitment.
We see this second award as encouragement and inspiration to continue refining and enhancing the Naladhu Private Island experience, and we can't wait to welcome new – and repeat – visitors to our little island to keep showing them what makes us so special."
While Naladhu Private Island enjoys unanimously positive feedback from guests, and has won a following of loyal repeat customers from around the world, the team is not content to rest on this success.
Improvements will continue to be made wherever opportunities arise, with the aim of taking an already outstanding resort experience to unprecedented levels.
Additions to some of the houses are just some of the refinements planned for 2019.

Reservations Team
Surrounded by nothing but turquoise lagoon which melts into sapphire blue, the island of Kihavah and its pure white sands rise up out of the ocean like a mirage.
For centuries, Arab traders en route to the Far East took shelter on the island, a lush paradise blessed by coconut, papaya and mango trees.
Navigating archipelago to archipelago by the stars, the seafarers were also drawn by the riches of the ocean surrounding the island  where a prehistoric volcano sank back into the depths, leaving blooming corals and a wealth of lagoon fish.
Wishing to keep the pristine nature of the island intact, not one tree has been moved  as evidenced by the villas growing up around them.
The design pays homage to the seafarers of old, fusing Indian Ocean, Arab and Portuguese motifs with indigenous materials.
Located on the Baa Atoll in a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, Anantara Kihavah Maldives Villas invites you to imagine your own paradise.

Coral Adoption
The coral has been regenerating since the El Niño events, but temperature fluctuations are still a cause for concern.
As part of our ongoing conservation effort to protect the reefs, Anantara has initiated the Coral Adoption Programme, inviting guests to participate in this long-term project by planting coral in our reef nursery and following growth with photo updates or return visits.
With the help of the resident Marine Biologist, transplant coral onto your rope in the lagoon and watch it being placed in one of our nurseries in a two-hour programme.
Make a return trip to our idyllic Maldivian island to see how much the reef and our nurseries have grown.
THE HOUSE REEF
coral adoption programme, anantara kihavah, maldives coral reef, tropical fish, biosphere reserve, learning experiences, regeneration of coral growth, kihavah, maldives
What's been your favourite experience so far around here?
Night diving.
Here at our house reef I have had the best night dives repeatedly of anywhere I've been lucky enough to see.
We almost always see over 30 rock lobsters hunting at the reef, lots of stingrays, nurse sharks, reef sharks, hunting moray eels, squid, octopus and many of the tiny little crabs and benthic fauna.
Flora and her team work hard to ensure that our house reef survives and thrives for many generations to come.
With the introduction of the Coral Adoption Programme, guests take broken fragments of coral and grow them on ropes until they are large enough to be planted on the reef - just like you would with flowers in your garden.
Each coral piece that is replanted helps the reef to prosper and allows each guest to play a vital role.
Join us in our endeavours.
Coral Adoption Programme is an environmental initiative done by Anantara Kihavah with the intention of protecting the Maldives coral reef in the Baa atoll region
MEET MARINE BIOLOGIST FLORA
Our house reef and its clear waters and myriad of marine life is one of the Maldives' most famous scuba and snorkelling utopias.
Descend into an explosion of colourful coral gardens and glide amongst schools of tropical fish.
Coral reefs protect our pristine beaches and guard the island's crystal-clear lagoon.
However, for all of its beauty and apparent resilience, coral is a sensitive organism, vulnerable to extreme weather and sudden environmental changes.
As a result of the 2015 and 2016 El Niño events, the Maldives lost most of its shallow coral reefs when sea temperatures increased by 4C.
CORAL ADOPTION PROGRAMME
Flora, Anantara Kihavah's very own Marine Biologist, has dedicated much of her life to the conservation and protection of the underwater world.
Here we catch up with Flora and delve into her insights into diving around Kihavah.
What is unique about Kihavah?
That we can take guests to a fantastic reef just one minute from the beach.
It's so great to see guests enjoy, admire, and become inspired to help protect the amazing biodiversity that coral reefs have to offer.
They are known as the 'rainforests of the sea' for a reason!
What surprises you the most about the waters around Kihavah?
The variation on offer here at the house reef, more commonly known as the 'Golden Wall' to local islanders.
I've seen everything from a manta ray to the smallest little decorator crabs!
We regularly see turtles, eagle rays, rock lobsters, moray eels, cleaner shrimp, stingrays and a beautiful array of colourful soft corals.

The bed was comfortable, the room spotless and the service incredible.
We took a cooking class, learned to fold towel animals and to carve fruit.

Best Rate Guarantee - Terms and Conditions
bestrateguarantee terms
"Minor Hotels Websites" are the websites owned or operated by or on behalf of Minor, including anantara.com, avanihotels.com and minorhotels.com.
"In the unlikely event that a lower rate at a Minor Hotel or an affiliate Hotel is made available on a non-Minor website or non-Minor mobile application (the "Competing Rate"), upon its receipt of a claim that satisfies these Best Rate Guarantee terms and conditions (the "BRG Terms"), Minor will honor that Competing Rate and provide the individual that submitted the valid claim one of the following rewards: (1) an additional 10% discount off the Competing Rate per room per night"
Submission Terms
For a claim to be eligible under the Best Rate Guarantee, it must be submitted through the claim submittal web form.
Customers with a Minor Hotels Website booking: A claim form must be submitted within twenty-four (24) hours after completing your valid room booking on any Minor Hotels Websites to make a claim under the Best Rate Guarantee.In addition, the claim must be submitted at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to the standard check-in time at the applicable Minor hotel.     Customers without a booking:A claim must be submitted at least seventy-two (72) hours prior to the standard check-in time at the applicable Minor hotel.     A claim form may be rejected by Minor if it is incomplete, is submitted in an unsupported language, or concerns a non-Minor Hotels website or mobile application that is in an unsupported language.     Only one claim may be submitted in connection with any confirmed reservation.
The name on the submitted claim form for such claim must match the name on the relevant confirmed reservation.
The "Best Rate Guarantee" will be offered provided that the following conditions are met:
Both rates, the rate booked through Minor Hotel Websites and the lower "comparison rate" found, must be:
A currently available published room rate available online or on a mobile application     For the same arrival date, same hotel, same number of guests, same room type (category, size, bedding, view)     With the same inclusions (tax, VAT, service charges, currency, food & beverage items, other inclusive items)     At the same booking conditions (minimum length of stay, minimum advance booking, advance purchase, deposit, change and cancellation policies or other conditions)     Different by a minimum of USD 1
If the Best Rate Guarantee claim refers to a reservation consisting of several nights' accommodation, the average rate for each night will be compared to the average rate for each night, for an identical reservation, using the website where the comparison rate is found.
The "Best Rate Guarantee" does not apply to the following:
Unpublished or negotiated rates (e.g., corporate discount rates, group rates, meeting rates)     Rates requiring a paid membership in a club or other organization or a free membership in a club or other organization if such membership is contingent upon the member's type of employment     Rates offered pursuant to direct mail or email solicitations, requiring a credit card in order to view the competing rate or the use of discount codes or coupons to book such competing rate, or otherwise not intended for the general public     Rates offered for stay at hotels owned or managed by Anantara Vacation Club resorts and properties     Rates offered by opaque providers (e.g., Expedia Package, Priceline or any secret deal) that do not provide the name or location of the hotel until after a reservation has been made     Rates offered on on-request websites and mobile applications that do not provide immediate hotel confirmations, including, without limitation, any such websites or mobile applications that require five minutes or more to validate a reservation     Rates displayed on websites that do not provide the ability to make a reservation directly(e.g., metasearch engines)     Rates for packages or bundles     Individual rate plans not offered to the general public     Rates which are published due to technical or system errors     Rate variations due to currency exchange rate fluctuations
Validity and Extent of Guarantee
The Best Rate Guarantee will be suspended during times where the Minor Hotels Website or certain rates are not available due to an outage, a technical issue or a circumstance beyond Minor's reasonable control.     Minor is not responsible for any fees associated with cancelling a reservation made through a different channel (e.g., a call centre, a non-Minor booking channel).     Customers with a Minor Hotels Website booking: In the event that a Best Rate Guarantee claim is validated, Minor will adjust the rate on the confirmed reservation to the lowest available rate that Minor is able to verify, a rate which may be different than the rate that was indicated on the applicable claim form.     A valid Best Rate Guarantee claim may be invalidated if: (1) the name on the submitted claim form does not match the guest's name on the relevant reservation, or (2) any changes are made to the relevant reservation after such reservation is made.     Minor may deny claims where the applicable Minor hotel will no longer be operating as a Minor hotel as applicable, on the date of the stay.     Any disputes arising out of or related to the Best Rate Guarantee or these Best Rate Guarantee Terms shall be handled individually without any class action, and shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Thailand.     Void where prohibited by law.
Minor reserves the right to amend, revise, supplement, suspend or discontinue the Best Rate Guarantee or these Best Rate Guarantee Terms at any time in its sole discretion and without prior notice.     Minor may at any time and without notice terminate or restrict a person's ability to submit a claim under or otherwise benefit from the Best Rate Guarantee, if in its sole discretion Minor determines that such person has: (1) acted in a manner inconsistent with applicable laws or ordinances; (2) acted in a fraudulent or abusive manner, (3) submitted multiple invalid Best Rate Guarantee claims; (4) failed to stay at the applicable Minor Hotels after receiving approved Best Rate Guarantee claims; or (5) breached any of theseBest Rate Guarantee Terms.  The Best Rate Guarantee is not applicable to hotels in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan or South Korea.

All elephants are given ample food, shelter, veterinary checks and care.
The mahout and his family receive food, housing, medical insurance, schooling for their children, and 100% of the profits from a traditional silk weaving business.

DISCOVER THE ESSENCE OF ESSENCE WITH CHEF KIEN
"Without excellent produce, there is no excellent cuisine," says Chef Kien Wagner, the man at the helm of Essence, your go-to gastro haven at Avani+ Samui.
For him, every day starts at the market, to pick out the finest, freshest fruit, vegetables, herbs and just-caught fish, all of which come from the island and its waters.
It's these hyperlocal goodies that inspire both Chef Kien and his menu at Essence.
Join us at the restaurant where, as Kien says, "the product is the star of the kitchen."
He shows them off in delicious dishes from Thai favourites to international classics like succulent salt and pepper squid fresh from the ocean, rich and creamy coconut curries and vibrant pasta dishes.
Our locavore Chef's expert foraging skills are reflected in a menu that's not only super local but heavily plant-based, with superfood-packed smoothies and rice paper wraps filled with veggies and herbs.
Even the desserts are (kind of) virtuous, with rainbows of tropical fruit decorating homemade coconut ice cream.
And if you're the mood for a little tipple, thirst-quenching cocktails are concocted with local flavours for those distinct and delectable island vibes
Come and meet Chef Kien, sample his honest-to-goodness food and discover the true "Essence" of Samui.

MEET THE CHEF
The team at The Spice Market is led by the charismatic Chef Warinthorn Sumrithphon.
She first joined Anantara as an intern 17 years ago, and has been with us ever since.

OUR STORY
At The Spice Market Bangkok, we have built a loyal following amongst our customers as one of the top Thai restaurants in Bangkok.
Despite the rapid changes over the last few decades, The Spice Market has remained comfortingly authentic.
ARCHITECTURE
Designed by the award-winning P49, every detail of the shophouse experience is brought to life at The Spice Market.
Our recipes can be traced back to the palace, our produce to family-owned farms, and our service to the Anantara ethos of intuitive grace.
OUR TEAM
Chef Warinthorn personally sources our fine ingredients – Thai-French beef from the Northeast, river prawns from the Gulf of Thailand, coconut from nearby Baan Phaew, and butterfly pea from the award-winning Suan Samphran.
Her attention to detail makes The Spice Market the best authentic Thai restaurant in Bangkok.
Chef Warinthorn started her formal training as a chef in 1997 at an esteemed institute in Bangkok and in various five-star hotel kitchens across the city.
She then attended Dusit Thani College in Bangkok and gained a Bachelor of Business Administration in Kitchen and Restaurant Management during which she was introduced to Spice Market via work experience in the kitchen.
She eventually joined the restaurant on a full-time basis on the completion of her studies.
She says the 'secret' to Spice Market, which has been in operation now for more than 36 years, is attention to detail.
"We pay attention to everything.
We anticipate food trends and stay on top of them – delighting our repeat customers is so important."
While she has kept the traditional dishes the restaurant became famous for, she adds subtle changes, sometimes including unexpected ingredients to keeping the menu current.
Designated staff trainer and dedicated to the restaurant and kitchen, Chef Warinthorn is the perfect representative of Spice Market's blend of Thai hospitality and charm.
Chef Warinthorn has seen Spice Market receive certificates of excellence in the Thai cuisine category from Bangkok Best Dining and Entertainment Magazine for several consecutive years, while on TripAdvisor the restaurant has been voted "Most Delicious Thai Restaurant in Bangkok" by the city's residents – deserved praise for both restaurant and chef.
Water urns, woven baskets and rice sacks set a rustic tone, while jars of spice give our romantic restaurant in Bangkok its distinctive name.
The cosy ambience is rounded out by live Thai music and a fruit carving display.

Anantara was born in 2001 in Thailand's royal seaside town, Hua Hin.
With a distinctive concept of bringing story collecting travellers closer to the cultural traditions, fascinating history and awesome topography of some of the world's most exotic destinations, our collection of unique beach, city, desert and jungle hideaways have since expanded across Thailand and beyond to China, Vietnam and Indonesia, as well as the breathtaking paradise of the Maldives and evocative settings in the Middle East and Africa.
Wherever your journey takes you, you'll experience Anantara's spirit of discovery and an invitingly warm hospitality that is rooted in beautiful Thailand, where our story first began.
For hundreds of years throughout Thailand, people would leave a jar of water outside their house to provide refreshment and extend a welcome to the passing traveller.
The name 'Anantara' is taken from an ancient Sanskrit word meaning 'without end', symbolising this sharing of water and the heartfelt approach that lies at the core of every Anantara experience.
Embrace your sense of adventure as you explore the diverse allures of incredible destinations from the lap of luxury.
Whether you come to get away from it all or to dive into something new, there is only one word to describe the experience that awaits: Anantara.

Surrounded by nothing but turquoise lagoon which melts into sapphire blue, the Maldives luxury resort island of Anantara Kihavah and its pure white sands rise up out of the ocean like a mirage.
For centuries, this was where Arab traders sailing to the Far East took shelter; a lush paradise blessed by coconut, papaya and mango trees.
Navigating archipelago to archipelago by the stars, the seafarers were also drawn by the riches of the ocean surrounding the island – where a prehistoric volcano sank back into the depths, leaving blooming corals within a house reef and a wealth of lagoon fish.Wishing to keep the pristine nature of the island intact, not one tree has been moved – as evidenced by the villas growing up around them.
The design pays homage to the seafarers of old, fusing Indian Ocean, Arab and Portuguese motifs with indigenous materials.
Located on the Baa Atoll in a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, Anantara Kihavah Maldives Villas invites you to imagine your own barefoot luxury paradise.
Savour the luxury of space in your private pool beach villa or over water villa.

Red-Whiskered Bulbul
Inspired by the distinctive plumage of Asia&rsquo;s red-whiskered bulbul, the uncontested star of many a bird singing contest held across Southern Thailand, this smooth bourbon-based cocktail is shaken with homemade bitters, Amaretto and egg white, with just a hint of homemade cinnamon syrup for an extra twist to a classic drink.
Summer Tanager Desire
An eye-catching sight against the green leaves of the forest, the strawberry-coloured summer tanager is the only completely red bird in North America.
Giving the cocktail its striking colour is the blend of strawberry liqueur, homemade roselle syrup and fresh passionfruit, while the drink&rsquo;s kick comes from a splash of Tequila.
The Violet Crow
Fiercely intelligent, playful and mischievous, humble crows are the unsung heroes of the bird kingdom.
Butterfly pea gives this rum-based cocktail its dark-blue tint inspired by the plumage of the Indonesian violet crow, while egg white adds some creamy richness and Maraschino liqueur  a jolt of brightness.

Charity
The Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation is a small Thai registered charity set up in 2005 to help elephants that could not help themselves, a task it initially achieved by rescuing street begging elephants and their handlers (mahouts) and bringing them to live on the 400 acre forest and grassland surrounding Anantara Golden Triangle Elephant Camp &#38; Resort in Far North Thailand.
This land is still home to 20 elephants but since 2005 the Foundation has adapted to changing circumstances and adopted three separate pillars: Captive Elephant Welfare, Wild Elephant Protection and Research and Education.
Working with the elephants on site and through well chosen partners the Foundation has been a key driver in the improvement of welfare for all captive elephants; hosting and supporting well attended free courses, seminars and workshops for elephant camp managers and mahouts in topics such as Target Training Positive Reinforcement, Environmental Enrichment &#38; Human Elephant Learning Programme's Elephant Friendly training techniques.
Indeed the Target Training Positive Reinforcement Workshop programme is already into its twelfth year and has reached hundreds of managers and mahouts responsible for thousands of elephants across eight countries.
The Foundation has three ongoing Wild Elephant Conservation projects.
The #SurvivingTogether project on the outskirts of Khao Yai National Park, Thailand which supports Community Conservation Clubs to gently intercept wild elephants when they leave the forest and through special techniques push them back before they can damage farmers' crops.
The foundation also provided infrastructure such as watch towers to more safely observe the elephants.
The second project works with Hunter College, New York University and supports their Comparative Cognition for Conservation Laboratory in their study of elephant behaviour both inside and outside another Thai National Park in efforts to promote Human Elephant Coexistence.
Perhaps most significant is funding the total protection of an 18,000ha wildlife corridor between Botum Sakor &#38; Southern Cardamom National Parks in Cambodia, a glimpse at the neighbouring concessions proves this natural standing rainforest, home to all manner of endangered species and a migration route for elephants, would not be standing without the Rangers' presence.
Recognising the Thailand's 4,000 year tradition of keeping and handling captive elephants will not modernise without the active agreement and input of the people who are heirs to that tradition the Foundation has provided the main home villages of these tradition keepers, surrounding Ban Ta Klang in Surin Province, with two full time English teachers who are working hard to broaden the horizons of future mahouts and decision makers.
Not only did the project take one of the local village schools from dead last to top one hundred in the province for average English score local students have entered provincial English competitions, unthinkable a decade ago.
During COVID lockdowns the income to feed Thailand's 3,800 captive elephants dried up totally leaving many elephants and mahouts to fend for themselves.
Despite likewise totally losing their traditional source of donations the Foundation managed to expand their work to take in and care for five 'COVID Refugee' elephants whose supporting camps went bankrupt.
They also, with partners, subsidised 13 vets and vet nurses around the country to assist the Government in providing free, much needed, veterinary care to any elephant through 18 months of travel restrictions.
To help people locked down around the world when COVID struck the Foundation expanded their #VirtualFieldtrip programme to give free online educational elephant experiences, tailored to curriculum, to any school in Thai or English language.
Even as the world wakes up they continue provide livestreams for people around the globe via their Facebook (GTAEF Helping Elephants) &#38; Instagram (@GTAEF_Thailand) channels.
The weekly Elephant Professional Lectures from experts on many elephant or conservation related topics as well Elephant Educational livestreams from their own veterinary and research teams from this period had over 11,000 views in 2021 alone and will remain a reference library for people studying elephants well into the future.
Post lockdowns the Foundation has been working to ensure their projects return to their pre-COVID footing.
Adding an additional focus on meeting &#38; sharing with various stakeholders with the intention to make the tourism recovery more sustainable for Thailand's elephants providing improved welfare across the board.

Get up-close to stunning manta rays in the protected environment of Hanifaru Bay.
With a wingspan of several metres, these fascinating creatures can number over 100 at the time of the full moon.
They enter the world&rsquo;s largest manta feeding destination to feed on small fish, plankton and crustaceans.
Plan in advance for the optimum time to witness these magnificent creatures in all their glory.
This offers a tremendous opportunity to swim alongside manta rays and imitate their graceful course through the ocean.
GENTLE MOVEMENTS OF THE WORLD BELOW
Manta ray snorkelling is seasonal and runs from May until November.
Guests are privy to insider information from the Anantara team who work closely with the rangers that protect Hanifaru Bay.
This helps us to plan for the most favourable time to catch these glorious creatures.
Anantara Kihavah also has a resident Marine Biologist who can provide seasonal information on the manta rays.
With pregnancies that last between 12 &ndash; 13 months, guests can see the mothers bloom and the rare occasion of a baby manta gliding through the water.
Manta rays are charismatic, gentle fish without a stinger.
Mesmerising in their movements, they provide an underwater spectacle quite unlike anything else.
A perfect adventure for families.

THINGS TO KNOW
     For a smooth experience try to arrive 15 minutes before your appointment.
Enjoy a refreshing beverage, fill out a quick consultation form, and get ready for spa time.     We love kids, but the spa isn&rsquo;t a fun place for them.
If you&rsquo;d like to leave your little ones in safe hands, just call our front office to ask about childcare services.     In your newly relaxed state, you might just forget a thing or two after treatment.
Leave anything you don&rsquo;t want to lose in your room.     No need to bring cash or a credit card.
All treatments are charged to your guest room and are payable at check‐out.     Let us know if you can&rsquo;t make your booked treatment.
We&rsquo;ll need at least four hours&rsquo; notice for single treatments and 24 hours for packages.
Otherwise, we&rsquo;ll need to charge you half the cost.     Don&rsquo;t burn up the bliss.
Please refrain from sunbathing after aromatherapy treatments.     Stubble just gets in the way.
Guys, make your decision before any facial treatment: grow or glow?     Calm is calling, but not on your phone.
Keep the spa peaceful and your mobile in your room.     Our spa is already delicately scented.
You really don&rsquo;t need to smoke here.     Please arrive on time to enjoy every blissful second of your treatment.
